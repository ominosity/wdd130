            <p>Hello to you, my friend. My name is Richard Burgener and here's a little bit about myself. My wife and I life in the beautiful state of Oregon, where we've been for the last two and a three-quarter years. We love being in close proximity to the ocean (an hour fifteen west) and the Cascade mountains (an hour to the east). I work as a Software Engineer for Petplace.com on both the Chameleon and PetPoint products. When I transitioned over to being a developer a couple of years ago, I decided I needed to go back to school for a degree specific to development, so I can learn the right (and current) way to do things. </p>

            <p>Oregon is located on the West Coast of the United States of America, sandwiched between California and Washington. It is a state of environmental contrasts and diversity. It boasts the contiguous United States only year-round ski resort (weather permitting) on a volcano (Mount Hood), but also contains endless miles of desert and an impressive Pacific Coast.</p>
