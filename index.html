            <p>Hello to you, my friend. My name is Richard Burgener and here's a little bit about myself. My wife and I
                life in the beautiful state of Oregon, where we've been for the last two and a three-quarter years. We
                love being in close proximity to the ocean (an hour fifteen west) and the Cascade mountains (an hour to
                the east). I work as a Software Engineer for Petplace.com on both the Chameleon and PetPoint products.
                When I transitioned over to being a developer a couple of years ago, I decided I needed to go back to
                school for a degree specific to development, so I can learn the right (and current) way to do things.
            </p>
            <p>I can't think of anything more interesting to say here, so here is some psuedo-random text from <a

            <p>Oregon is located on the West Coast of the United States of America, sandwiched between California and
                Washington. It is a state of environmental contrasts and diversity. It boasts the contiguous United
                States only year-round ski resort (weather permitting) on a volcano (Mount Hood), but also contains
                endless miles of desert and an impressive Pacific Coast.</p>
